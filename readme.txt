My project name is Othello or Reversi and it is a recreation of
of the game Othello/Reversi while also incorporation aspects of
multiplayer games such as signing up, logging in etc.

Instructions:
Make sure all jpg files are included (even the ones with the big numbers).
Then, simply run the reversi.py file and the program will run.

Commands are mouse based and any functions that need keyboard input
have comments to indicate how to utilize them.
